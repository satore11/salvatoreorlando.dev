      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="/profile-photo.jpg" alt="Salvatore Orlando" class="profile-photo">

      <p>I'm Salvatore Orlando, a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and System Integration Architect based in Sicily, Italy.
        For over 13 years, I've been building web platforms, modernizing legacy systems, and architecting complex
        integrations that connect enterprise systems and drive business value.</p>

      <p>I'm currently Head of Development at Digitouch, where I lead a team of 5 engineers and serve as technical
        architect for enterprise projects. My work spans from hands-on coding to coordinating multi-vendor integrations
        and implementing AI-augmented development workflows.</p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>

      <p><strong>2012-2016: Learning the Fundamentals</strong><br>
        Started at Neuron Web Agency, building websites and web applications for major international brands across
        automotive, financial, and consumer goods sectors. This is where I learned database design, performance
        optimization, and how to communicate with clients effectively. Built everything from interactive social media
        campaigns to data-intensive business applications.</p>

      <p><strong>2016-2018: Going Independent</strong><br>
        Worked as a freelance developer, delivering projects for multiple web agencies. Diversified into e-commerce
        platforms, mobile applications, and custom business management solutions. Learned to manage client expectations,
        scope projects, and deliver on tight deadlines.</p>

      <p><strong>2018-2019: First Leadership Role</strong><br>
        Technical coordinator at AmicoPay, leading a team of 6 developers building a complete payment gateway solution
        from scratch. Designed system architecture supporting multiple payment methods, third-party integrations.
        First real taste of technical leadership and the challenges of coordinating a team.</p>

      <p><strong>2019-2021: Business Automation Focus</strong><br>
        At CDS, specialized in building business automation tools. Developed automated tender management systems,
        inventory control panels, and pricing engines. Learned how to reduce manual work through thoughtful automation,
        achieving results like 80% reduction in manual data entry.</p>

      <p><strong>2022-Present: Head of Development</strong><br>
        Leading development at Digitouch. My role evolved from pure hands-on development to a hybrid of technical
        architecture, team leadership, and strategic decision-making. Architecting enterprise integrations connecting
        systems like SAP, Amazon Business, and payment gateways. Recently implementing AI-augmented development
        initiatives to boost team productivity.</p>

      <h2>What I Do Best</h2>

      <h3>Legacy System Modernization</h3>
      <p>I specialize in transforming aging monoliths into modern, scalable architectures. This means
        reverse-engineering
        old systems, understanding business logic buried in decades-old code, and migrating to modern stacks without
        data loss. I've transformed 10+ year old systems with 250+ table databases into streamlined architectures,
        handling complex data migration strategies while maintaining zero downtime.</p>

      <h3>System Integration Architecture</h3>
      <p>I design and implement integration layers that connect multiple enterprise systems—ERPs, CMSs, payment
        gateways,
        fulfillment platforms. This involves coordinating stakeholders across different organizations, designing API
        contracts, managing data flows, and building resilient architectures that handle failure gracefully. I've
        architected integrations connecting 6+ external systems for enterprise clients.</p>

      <h3>Technical Leadership</h3>
      <p>I mentor developers through quarterly goal-setting, regular 1:1s, and code reviews. I balance technical debt
        against feature velocity, make architectural decisions that consider both technical excellence and business
        constraints, and foster a culture of continuous learning. I lead by example—staying hands-on with code while
        providing strategic direction.</p>

      <h2>My Approach</h2>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Understand the problem deeply before writing code.</strong> I spend time with stakeholders to
          understand the real business problem, not just the stated technical requirement.</p>

        <p><strong>Choose the right tool for the job, not the trendy one.</strong> Docker Swarm over Kubernetes when
          it makes sense. Boring, proven technology over the latest JavaScript framework.</p>

        <p><strong>Pragmatic over perfect.</strong> Ship working solutions that solve real problems. Refactor when
          needed, not when it feels good.</p>

        <p><strong>Own the solution end-to-end.</strong> From initial architecture to production deployment to
          monitoring and optimization. I take responsibility for outcomes, not just code.</p>

        <p><strong>Focus on measurable business impact.</strong> Every technical decision should connect to business
          value. Faster deployment cycles, reduced manual errors, improved conversion rates—these are the metrics
          that matter.</p>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>

      <p>I'm seeking remote Senior/Lead Engineer or Solutions Architect opportunities in product-focused companies
        where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Technical depth and architectural thinking drive meaningful impact</li>
        <li>Continuous learning is valued and encouraged</li>
        <li>Team collaboration is prioritized over individual heroics</li>
        <li>Pragmatic problem-solving outweighs dogmatic adherence to methodologies</li>
        <li>Business context informs technical decisions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I thrive in environments where I can balance hands-on technical work with strategic architectural decisions,
        where I can mentor other developers while continuing to grow my own skills, and where technical excellence
        serves clear business objectives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>

      <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Gaming (Chess or PC/Console)</li>
        <li>Tinkering with hardware setups—mechanical keyboards, IoT projects, workstation optimization</li>
        <li>Home Lab & IT Infrastructure (self-hosted services, network/server management)</li>
        <li>Following Formula 1 (tifoso at heart)</li>
        <li>Full-time companion to an energetic Weimaraner.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I believe the best engineers are curious about everything, not just code. These interests keep me creative,
        teach me patience and attention to detail, and remind me that solving complex problems can also be fun.</p>
